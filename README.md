# Jam.NET

Jam.NET is a free software client that reimplements the functionality of the abandoned app "Jammit".

For bleeding-edge testing, you can download builds from [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maxton/jam-net/build/artifacts).

More stable builds will be released periodically in [the releases tab](https://github.com/maxton/Jam.NET/releases).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.
For code style, please note that this project uses the default C# code style, but with 2 spaces instead of tabs.
PRs not adhering to the style will not be merged.

When VS2017 is released we will use the .editorconfig file to automatically configure code style.

Please note that if you contribute to this project, you agree that you are licensing your contribution under the
